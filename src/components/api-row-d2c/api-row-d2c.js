            <p>
              We take time to analyse so that we can identify and document the
              modifications and changes that are present in Enterprise Edition
              and can be copied to community edition.
            </p>

              Extensions which are currently in use are check for the support in

            <p>
              For the process of Community Edition migration additional web
              hosting account is created. Mage Monkeys advised as not to tamper
              all the original Enterprise installations unless we get
              confirmation from the clients as what they want to migrate and
              replace in community edition.

              Yes, in enterprise edition if the login template does not work we
              make sure that community version work well when downgraded from
              enterprise edition.
            </p>

            <p>
              Data is vital and thus data of customer and products are exported
              from enterprise to community edition.
            </p>

            <p>
              Management regarding URL redirection is available in community
              edition where it is absent in enterprise edition.
